~$ sudo vim /etc/hosts
Alter the hosts files (in superuser mode since it is readonly).
Add a new line to the file and fill it with the following details:
	46.19.122.85 intra.42.fr
Save and then visit intra.42.fr and notice that you get redirected to another site.
You do not need to use vim, you can echo into the file or use any text editor too.
